# FinchIt (was PinIt)

FinchIt is an AR based social network for sharing and exploring captured moments floating around you. FinchIt is only available on iOS for now!

Through FinchIt you can view moments captured in a photo or a video, by you or anyone, within few meters of your current location floating in front of you. You can interact with the moments, by dragging them around, zooming in on them, and have fun.
You can also capture your moments, so that you and others can see it floating at your capture location.
